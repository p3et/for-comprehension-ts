# for-comprehension-ts
Programming with monads such as Option, Either or Try is nice way to write programs that focus on domain logic rather than error handling. 
However, real world programs typically require large closures which then lead to accordingly large pyramids of braces. 
Haskell's do-notation or Scala's for-comprehension are a nice way to solve this problem and provide context to monad operations.  

With this repository we try to find a way that allows for an according notation in Typescript that is fully capable to handle async code:

```typescript
For._("a", Some.of(1))
   ._("b", () => Promise.resolve("two"))
   ._("c", () => Some.of(3))
   ._("d", ({a, c}) => Promise.resolve(Some.of([c, a])))
   .yield(({a, b, c, d}) => (a + b.length + c) * d.sort()[0])
   .then(option => {
       expect(isPresent(option)).toBeTruthy();
       expect(option.unwrap()).toBe(7);
   })
```
